I took this course to help focus more on enhancing my current skill-set and reduce my reliance on external JS libraries, And I decided to mix it up by using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Jade Templating Engine](http://jadelang.net). I'm documenting this to share my learning with others, or recommend to JS n00bs, that haven't written enough or want to learn JavaScript.

### `prerequisites`
You're going to need:

 - **Node.js, version 6.9.1 or newer**
 - **Jade** ‚Äî If Node.js is already installed, just run `npm install jade -g` in a terminal.

### `clone`
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone *your forked repository* (not the original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/JS30days.git`
3. `cd JS30days`
4. Initialize and start the project:

```shell
$ npm install -g nodemon
$ npm install
$ npm start

# > nodemon index
# [nodemon] 1.11.0
# [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
# [nodemon] watching: *.*
# [nodemon] starting `node index index.js`
# stuff happening ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø *: 1334
```

You can now see the app at `http://localhost:1334`. Whoa!
